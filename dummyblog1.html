            Dummy text: Its function as a filler or as a tool for comparing the
            visual impression of different typefaces Dummy text is text that is used
            in the publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which
            will later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for
            example, the final text is not yet available. Dummy text is also known
            as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy
            texts as lyrics when writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made'
            text to sing with the melody. Dummy texts have been in use by
            typesetters since the 16th century.

        <h2>The usefulness of nonsensical content</h2>
        <p>
            Dummy text is also used to demonstrate the appearance of different
            typefaces and layouts, and in general the content of dummy text is
            nonsensical. Due to its widespread use as filler text for layouts,
            non-readability is of great importance: human perception is tuned to
            recognize certain patterns and repetitions in texts. If the distribution
            of letters and 'words' is random, the reader will not be distracted from
            making a neutral judgement on the visual impact and readability of the
            typefaces (typography), or the distribution of text on the page (layout
            or type area). For this reason, dummy text usually consists of a more or
            less random series of words or syllables. This prevents repetitive
            patterns from impairing the overall visual impression and facilitates
            the comparison of different typefaces. Furthermore, it is advantageous
            when the dummy text is relatively realistic so that the layout
            impression of the final publication is not compromised.
